## 1. Introduction

In SCADA-based and industrial setups, timely availability of spare parts is critical for continuous operation. Traditionally, spare part inventories were managed manually, leading to inefficiencies like delays, stockouts, and overstocking.

This project offers a **digital inventory solution** using the **MERN Stack** that streamlines the process by enabling real-time tracking, alerts for low stock, and an intuitive web interface.

---

## 2. Objective

- Build a user-friendly interface to manage spare part inventory  
- Allow adding new parts with relevant details  
- Enable quantity adjustments with proper validation  
- Display alerts when stock falls below a defined threshold  
- Maintain a real-time synchronized view across all users

## 3. Technology Stack

| Component | Technology            |
|----------|------------------------|
| Frontend | React.js + Tailwind CSS|
| Backend  | Node.js + Express.js   |
| Database | MongoDB                |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub     |

---

## 4. Features

### ‚û§ Add New Part  
A form to input part details:
- Part Name  
- Quantity  
- Machine  
- Location  

Data is added to the database and reflected immediately in the inventory list.

### ‚û§ View Inventory  
All parts are listed in a structured, scrollable table. Each entry shows:
- Part Name  
- Quantity  
- Associated Machine  
- Storage Location  

### ‚û§ Quantity Adjustment  
- `+` and `‚àí` buttons to increase or decrease the quantity  
- Real-time sync with both frontend and MongoDB  

### ‚û§ Low Stock Alert  
- If a part's quantity is **‚â§ 5**, a low stock warning appears at the top  
- A red badge is shown next to that part in the list

## 5. MongoDB Schema

```json
{
  "partName": "Motor Bearing",
  "quantity": 3,
  "machine": "Boiler Unit #1",
  "location": "Store Room A",
  "addedOn": "2025-06-03T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## 6. Real-World Applications
This system is suitable for:

1. College laboratories managing tools and devices
2. Industrial warehouses maintaining critical components
3. Power stations tracking spare parts for maintenance
4. SCADA systems needing digital asset tracking

## 7. Future Scope
1. Implement authentication with Admin and Worker roles
2. Email notifications for critical stock levels
3. Export inventory data to PDF or Excel
4. QR code scanning to fetch part data
5. Dashboard with analytics on part usage and trends

## 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a simple, scalable web application can optimize inventory operations in real-world environments. By leveraging the MERN stack, we created a responsive system that automates manual processes, reduces errors, and ensures efficient spare parts management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
-   [Node.js (v16 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [MongoDB (if applicable)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
-   `git`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    -   Create a `.env` file by copying the example file.
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Update the `.env` file with your environment variables (database connection string, JWT secret, etc.).
        ```env
        PORT=8000
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    -   If your frontend requires environment variables (like the API base URL), create a `.env.local` file.
        ```env
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
        ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    -   **Start the Backend Server:** (from the `backend` directory)
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    -   **Start the Frontend Development Server:** (from the `frontend` directory)
        ```sh
        npm run dev # or npm start
        ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured frontend port) to see the application in action!
